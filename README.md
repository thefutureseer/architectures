# architectures

There are various types of architectures, each serving different purposes and requirements. Here are some of the most common architectures used in high tech:

- Client-server architecture
- Peer-to-peer architecture
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA)
- Microservices architecture
- Monolithic architecture
- Event-driven architecture (EDA)
- Cloud-native architecture
- Layered architecture
- Domain-driven design (DDD)
- Big Data architecture
- Reactive architecture

Each architecture has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of architecture depends on factors such as the business requirements, scalability, availability, performance, security, and cost.
